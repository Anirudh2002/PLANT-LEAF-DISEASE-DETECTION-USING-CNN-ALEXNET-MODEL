# PLANT-LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-CNN-ALEXNET-MODEL
This project uses AI and ML to build an automated plant disease detection system with image classification. By training a deep learning model on leaf images, it identifies and classifies plant diseases accurately, enabling early detection, faster intervention, and improved crop health management.
